Jumper wire: 

A jumper wire is a electrical wire used to connect two terminals or pins on a breadboard, development board, or other electronic components. It's a short, flexible wire that allows you to "jump" a connection from one point to another, hence the name.

In the context of my task, I use jumper wires to connect your IoT development board (e.g. ESP32 or Arduino) to a temperature sensor, humidity sensor, or other components.

Here are some details about jumper wires:

- Typically 20-25 AWG (American Wire Gauge) wire
- Insulated with a flexible plastic or rubber coating
- Ends are usually terminated with a pin or socket that can be inserted into a breadboard or development board
- Available in various colors and lengths

Breadboard 

A breadboard is a reusable platform used to build and prototype electronic circuits. It's a plastic board with a grid of holes and copper connections that allow you to easily connect and disconnect electronic components, wires, and other devices.

Here are some key features of a breadboard:

- Grid of holes: Typically 0.1 inches (2.54 mm) spaced, allowing for easy insertion of component leads
- Copper connections: Underneath the board, connecting holes in a specific pattern (usually rows and columns)
- Reusable: Components can be easily removed and replaced without damaging the board
- Versatile: Suitable for building a wide range of electronic projects, from simple circuits to complex prototypes

Breadboards are commonly used in electronics prototyping, circuit design, and development, making them a fundamental tool for makers, students, and professionals alike.


Micro-USB 

A Micro-USB is a type of connector used for charging and data transfer between devices. It's a smaller version of the standard USB (Universal Serial Bus) connector, typically used on mobile devices, cameras, and other portable electronics.
